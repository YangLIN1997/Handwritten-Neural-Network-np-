# Deep Neural Network for Multiclass Classfication

Author: Yang Lin

##### 1. Load data and preprocessing
##### 2. Use NN
##### 3. Train with full data set

##### Dataset: 
    fashion mnist

##### Deep Neural Network:
    Handwritten neural network with numpy, math and matplotlib libraries only
    Functionalities:         
            weight initialization: "random", "he", "xavier" or "heuristic"
            activation function: "sigmoid", "relu" or "leaky_relu"
            gradient descent: "batch", "mini batch" or "stochastic"
            optimization: "gradient descent", "momentum", "RMSProp" or "adam"
            regulation: "L2", "dropout" or "batch normalization"
            early stoping: stop training when cost is low
